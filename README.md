<h1>HOW TO RUN</h1>

<h1>Linux & MacOS</h1>


<h1>Please note the following dependencies</h1>

Python

Install Python and Pip. For instructions please check the <a href="https://python.org/downloads/">Downloads website</a>




<h1>Now for installation</h1>
<p>You guys are lucky. You guys have installers. Simply run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PhotonMastr/ConvertU-CLI
```

and then run

```sh
cd ConvertU-CLI
```

Now, you have to note what shell you're using. IF you know what shell you are using ignore this commmand but if you do not run this command

```sh
ps -p $$
``` 
it should print out the following...

Once you have noted your shell name simply run 

```sh
chmod +x install-[shell name].sh
```

and then

```sh
./install-[shell name.sh]
```

It will tell you when it is installed. Now that it is installed you can run 

```sh
ConvertU
```

And that's it for Linux/MacOS
